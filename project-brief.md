# Object Oriented Computing II - Project Assessment
For this project you are required to design and develop a JavaFX GUI (Graphical User Interface) application. The application must manage objects of the type you have chosen from the `Project Object Choice List`, which is available on the Moodle page. You will use an ArrayList to store and manage the objects.

## ‚ö° Minimum Project Requirments
- You must use the Project GitHub Repository provided to you on the Moodle page. No other development set up will be acceptable. This link to create your repository can be found under the `Project Assessment` section on Moodle. You need to click on the link to create your repository. This repository will contain all documentation, application code and any resources (e.g., input and output files, images etc) used by your application. Please note, no materials outside of your GitHub repository are gradable. Using another GitHub repository or not using GitHub at all for this project will incur a penalty of 60%. If you do not understand what is meant by this, then email me before you begin your project.
- This application must be developed using GitHub Codespaces.
- Project development must be tracked on GitHub via regular commits. Your GitHub repository must have at minimum two commits per week, if not I may contact you for a live project demonstration. The project will be capped at 40% if you fail to attend this meeting.    
- The README file should contain clear instructions for compiling, deploying, and running the application. It should also briefly outline the nature of the project and detail the set of features it contains. All sections of the README template must be filled out and add more sections if you please. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Minimum Feature Requirements
The application must incorporate, at minimum, the following features:
- A Java collections ArrayList to store your objects.
- A class to manage these objects. This manager class must be able to add, remove, serialize, deserialize, find total and search for the objects in the ArrayList you create.
- Use of the Stream API
- File IO
- Exception Handling
- Serialisation of Objects
- JavaFX GUI

## üìù Coding Standards
- Your code must compile
- Consistent code formatting
- Code commentary is essential. Comment every class and method at minimum. 

## ‚≠ê Enhanced Features
To achieve a high grade:
- Go above and beyond the minimum by adding extra methods (e.g., a method to list all objects by their unique ID in the array) and features (e.g., ask the user to choose the size of the array) to your application which you have researched yourself. Document any extra methods or features in your README.
- Add JavaFX features not demonstrated in labs.
- Create an animated gif of you using your application and add it to your Readme.
- Create an executable jar file that opens your application independently and include this in your GitHub repository.

## Submission Process
1. Create a 5-minute screen cast video of you demoing your app. Explain your code and point out any extras you added. Add this video to your GitHub repository. You can create a screencast using Microsoft Streams
2. Your GitHub repository will stop accepting commits on the submission Due Date. Make sure you have committed your finished code before then by checking your repository on GitHub
3. Download a copy of your final Git repository from the GitHub website
4. Submit the zip file to Moodle before the due date. The due date can be found by clicking on the submission link on Moodle. Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day
5. In the Moodle submission text box, include:

**GitHub Link:** [Your repository URL]  
**Screencast Link:** [Your screencast URL]

## Example Projects

- Favourite Football players App. Add them a list. Remove them. Search for them
- Car Garage App. Store list of cars. When fixed remove car
- Pizza Shop Orders App. Add pizzas on order. Remove when delivered. Search
- Shop Inventory system. Add items. Remove when sold. Search inventory
- Stamp Collection List. Add and remove stamps. Store in file for safe keeping
