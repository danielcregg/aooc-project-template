# Object Oriented Computing II - Project Assessment
For this project you are required to design and develop a JavaFX GUI (Graphical User Interface) application. The application must manage objects of the type you have chosen from the `Project Object Choice List`, which is available on the Moodle page. You will use an ArrayList to store and manage the objects.

## âš¡ Minimum Project Requirments
- You must use the Project GitHub Repository provided to you on the Moodle page. No other development set up will be acceptable. This link to create your repository can be found under the `Project Assessment` section on Moodle. You need to click on the link to create your repository. This repository will contain all documentation, application code and any resources (e.g., input and output files, images etc) used by your application. Please note, no materials outside of your GitHub repository are gradable. Using another GitHub repository or not using GitHub at all for this project will incur a penalty of 60%. If you do not understand what is meant by this, then email me before you begin your project.
- This application must be developed using GitHub Codespaces.
- Project development must be tracked on GitHub via regular commits. Your GitHub repository must have at minimum two commits per week, if not I may contact you for a live project demonstration. The project will be capped at 40% if you fail to attend this meeting.    
- The README file should contain clear instructions for compiling, deploying, and running the application. It should also briefly outline the nature of the project and detail the set of features it contains. All sections of the README template must be filled out and add more sections if you please. 

Please note:
- **No materials outside of your GitHub repository are gradable**
- Using another GitHub repository or not using GitHub at all for this project will get a penalty of 60%
- If you do not understand what is meant by this, then email me before you begin your project
- Your GitHub repository must have at minimum two commits per week
- If I have questions about your code, you will be asked to present your code in a live Teams Meeting (Project is graded out of 50% if you fail to attend this meeting)
- All documentation will be contained within the README file of the GitHub repository
- Only documentation in the README file of your repository will be graded
- Other documents (e.g., word docs etc) in your Git repository will not be graded
- The README file should contain clear instructions for compiling, deploying, and running the application
- It should also briefly outline the nature of the project and detail the set of features it contains
- All sections of the README template must be filled out and add more sections if you please

### Project Code Requirements

The project code must follow these minimum requirements:

- The code must compile and execute
- The code must be formatted in a consistent and standard way
- The code must contain comments free of spelling and grammatical errors. One comment per Class, method, and variable at minimum

### Required Application Features

The application must incorporate, at minimum, the following features:

- Java collections (e.g., to create a structure to store objects)
- Exception Handling
- File IO
- Use of the Stream API
- Serialisation of Objects
- JavaFX GUI

## Helpful Directions for Development

- Choose the object you wish to manage (e.g., phone objects) from the list provided on the course Moodle page. Do **NOT** use Student objects or your project will be graded out of 40%
- Create at minimum 4 instance variables for your object of choice. Each variable must be of a different type
- Create a class to manage these objects. This manager class must be able to add, remove, serialize, deserialize, find total and search for the objects in an object list you create
- All your JavaFX code will be contained in the Main class

## For Improved Grade 

- Go above and beyond the minimum by adding extra design features and functionality to your application that you have researched yourself. Document any extra features or functionality in your README
- Create an animated gif of you using parts your application and add it to your Readme
- Create an executable jar file that opens your application independently and include this in your GitHub repository

## Submission Process

1. Create a 5-minute screen cast video of you demoing your app. Explain your code and point out any extras you added. Add this video to your GitHub repository. You can create a screencast using Microsoft Streams
2. Your GitHub repository will stop accepting commits on the submission Due Date. Make sure you have committed your finished code before then by checking your repository on GitHub
3. Download a copy of your final Git repository from the GitHub website
4. Submit the zip file to Moodle before the due date. The due date can be found by clicking on the submission link on Moodle. Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day
5. In the Moodle submission text box, include:

**GitHub Link:** [Your repository URL]  
**Screencast Link:** [Your screencast URL]

## Example Projects

- Favourite Football players App. Add them a list. Remove them. Search for them
- Car Garage App. Store list of cars. When fixed remove car
- Pizza Shop Orders App. Add pizzas on order. Remove when delivered. Search
- Shop Inventory system. Add items. Remove when sold. Search inventory
- Stamp Collection List. Add and remove stamps. Store in file for safe keeping
